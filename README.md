# Personal Website

Personal website I built from scratch to showcase all of my programming skills and projects. It is the first website I have created, so I used vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript so that I have a strong fundamental foundation to build upon. In future I hope to make the website more mobile-friendly, as that was not a priority when I started coding this site.
